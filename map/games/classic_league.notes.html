Classic 2nd Edition (1984) for use with League.
			<br> This is a modification to the original Classic module ("World War II Classic"). This module checks for violation of stack limits and also has a rework of the optional rules in the game options. This module can also be used for non-League games.
			<br>
			<br> Axis need to at the end of the round control 2 out of 3 allied capitals plus their own capitals to win OR get to 84 production at end of round.
			<br> Allies need to control both Axis capitals plus their own capitals.
			<br> (Optional rule: Allies win if they get to 110 production at end of round [to enable, change Allied economic victory from 140 to 110]).
			<br>
			<br>One can choose/alter the following optional rules:
			<ul>
			<li> neutralCharge - sets a number of IPCs you must pay to invade a neutral nation. Neutrals Are Impassable must be disabled.</li>
			<li> Russia Restricted - Russia cannot attack the first turn.</li>
			<li> Neutrals Are Impassable - no invasion of neutral nations.</li>
			<li> No New Complexes - no new Industrial Complexes can be built by any player, only the ones already on the map are in play.</li>
			<li> Tech Development - if enabled, you play with the Develop Weapons rules. One can decide whether to allow tech from a certain round. This must be player-enforced.</li>
			<li> Unit Placement In Enemy Seas - allows you to place naval units in sea zones even if they contain enemy units.</li>
			<li> Weapons Development Benefits - Gives Germany Jet Power and Japan Super Subs from the start of the game.</li>
